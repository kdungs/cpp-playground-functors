# Functors

_Note: The word functors is not used in the usual functional programming sense but refers to LoKi functors in the LHCb software which in turn derive their name from function objects ("callables") in C++_

In order to compile the code use `CMake` and `ninja`.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```
